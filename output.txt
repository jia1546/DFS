the linked list representation of the graph is:
1: 4 2 
2: 5 
3: 6 5 
4: 2 
5: 4 
6: 6 

the process of DFS:
run DFS on node 1
run DFS on node 4
run DFS on node 2
run DFS on node 5
run DFS on node 3
run DFS on node 6

node:		1	2	3	4	5	6	
color:		1	1	1	1	1	1	
PI:		-1	4	-1	1	2	3	
discover time:	1	3	9	2	4	10	
finish time:	8	6	12	7	5	11
