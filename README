This program simulate the process of DFS

To run this program, you have to save the initiation data of the graph into the file "input.txt". And redirect this file to the program. The format of "input.txt" is as follows:
n p
node other_node
node other_node
......
where n is the number of nodes in the graph
	  p is the number of edges in the graph
	  and the following p lines give the edges
Note: We assume the graph to be directed
